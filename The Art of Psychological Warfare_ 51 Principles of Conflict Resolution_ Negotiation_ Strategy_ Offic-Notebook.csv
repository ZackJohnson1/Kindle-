"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 46","","Principle 1: Most aspects of business and life involve never ending psychological battle."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 60","","Inevitably, other people's desires come up against our own. There is conflict. There is battle. And that battle is often purely psychological."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 63","","In a world of constant transition, there is uncertainty. When there is uncertainty, there is aggression."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 69","","Your time, energy, talent, and mental strength are your currency in psychological warfare. Resources such as money just posture you better, but they don't necessarily protect you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 74","","Principle 2: Self-interest rules the world."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 87","","Principle 3: The personal paradox: everything is personal, yet nothing is personal."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 89","","Business life and personal life are emotionally inseparable. And when people come at you, it's very hard not to take it personally.   The thing to understand is that people pursue their self-interest. They may say things which appear personal, but this is just a tactic to demoralize you so that their self-interest can be advanced."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 94","","The master warrior constantly works on and refines his personal psychology so that the actions of others don't cause him to self-destruct as a result of taking attacks personally."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 99","","Principle 4: You cannot avoid attack. The world will exploit you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 101","","There are tactics which can deter others from coming after you, but aggression from opponents cannot be completely demolished."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 103","","People pursue their self-interest and will take everything from you that they can."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 106","","Principle 5: If all is fair in love and war, then the concept of fairness has little to no value."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 107","","Forget about fairness. Nothing in business or life is fair. There will likely be no justice for you when you are attacked or exploited. Typically, the most practical reason to play the ""fairness"" card is as a tactic to shame the opponent, and only if it can help position your self-interest."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 112","","Principle 6: Choose your battles carefully."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 114","","Just because you are attacked doesn't mean you have to attack back. You do not have the strength to fight every war."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 116","","Do not wage psychological war with others just because you can, for that is a waste of energy. Take a deep breath, step back, and carefully think through the cost of going to war and whether the probabilistic payoff is worth the cost."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 120","","Remember, your time and energy are your most precious resources in life. Use them wisely."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 121","","Principle 7: It is better to die by the sword when you live by the sword."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 126","","The trick here is to attack the right people. Attack the opponents who stand in your way and who you believe you can defeat or gain an advantage from."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 129","","Principle 8: People are magnificent actors on the stages of business and life; judge them based on their actions, not their words and presentations."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 130","","Many people in the world live in self-deceit. This is dangerous because they truly believe they are being sincere when they articulate their supposed good intentions and lack of self-interest."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 132","","I'm not saying that you should not trust anyone. Nor am I suggesting that you succumb to paranoia. But I am saying that you should remain vigilant and analytical."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 145","","Principle 9: Goal setting is inherently aggressive."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 146","","But know that your pursuit of goals, which represent your self-interest, will inevitably collide with the self-interest of others; and then there will be war."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 152","","Therefore, any goal you set for yourself will lead to competition with others, which will lead to battle, which will lead to war."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 156","","Principle 10: Boldness is a function of tolerance and ambition."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 168","","Principle 11: Guard your vulnerabilities; volunteer information conservatively."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 169","","There can sometimes be power in stating your vulnerabilities, but this is an advanced gambit indeed and should be reserved for the truly bold."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 171","","For the most part, you want to guard your vulnerabilities and devulge only information which would keep your opponents from attacking you. When an opponent knows your vulnerability, they will think long and hard about it, and then attack it fiercely at a moment you least expect it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 177","","Principle 12: Artfully stroke the King's ego."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 179","","King (or a Queen) is anyone more powerful than you, regardless of domain: work, social, business, family, etc. Kings seem to exist for the sole purpose of kicking you around. You must learn to artfully stroke their egos."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 184","","Point out subtle details to the King in what he is doing, and tell him you are learning a lot from just being around him, and that it is making you a better person. In general, it's better not to compliment the obvious, but to look a little deeper at the details of his behavior and compliment more subtle aspects of it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 188","","Principle 13: Only attack a King with extreme care and deft."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 189","","Most often it is wise to play dumb to a King. Impress him only enough that he gives you what you obviously want."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 212","","Principle 14: Beware of the ambitious upstart..."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 215","","Furthermore, the ambitious upstart is dangerous because he is often talented in addition to being bold. He is hot stuff and he knows it. He may, however, have deep insecurities that you can exploit, but proceed with caution."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 217","","If you are an ambitious upstart and you piss off a King, he will wait patiently to destroy you. Kings are most concerned and insecure about ambitious upstarts and will destroy them when they can. Remember the value of playing dumb to the King."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 219","","Principle 15: Exploit others with grace and care."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 226","","Principle 16: Familiarize yourself with the field of battle; avoid fighting the opponent on their turf."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 227","","You must know the territory and terrain upon which you will fight the opponent. Knowledge of the terrain is definitely power in warfare."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 239","","Principle 17: Consciously drive your neuroses in the direction of rational benign self-interest and self-improvement."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 255","","You will know your opponent is driving their neuroses against you when they do something irrational against you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 258","","What you most want to avoid is an opponent's neurotic drive colliding with your neurotic drive, for this means the war has gone nuclear - only a fool engages in nuclear war."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 262","","Principle 18: Embrace the reality of passive aggression as it relates to psychological warfare."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 275","","Principle 19: Engage in active listening as a means of passive aggression and psychological warfare."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 286","","Principle 20: Discover the group your opponent dwells in and attack different factions of the group in unique ways."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 287","","This is a very dangerous tactic. Use this tactic at your own risk. The payoff can be huge, but it can also blow up in your face, as you may create new opponents who will be determined and unified in destroying you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 294","","Principle 21: When you aim, you aim to kill."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 296","","What I am saying, is that unless you are executing a relatively benign test attack, you should aim to knock your opponent down completely so that they don't attempt another attack on you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 299","","Psychological warfare, like all warfare, is costly. You have nothing to gain by prolonging it. As a general rule, it's best to attack ferociously in hopes that the opponent gives up."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 303","","Principle 22: Feign unpredictability and irrationality to your opponent."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 304","","Unpredictability and irrationality will often scare the hell out of your opponent, especially if they have something to lose. Therefore, this is often a useful tactic to employ."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 306","","Unpredictability is scary because it means that the opponent must continue to stay on guard if they wish to continue attacking you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 316","","Principle 23: Use the power of creative brainstorming to overwhelm the opponent with tactics."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 317","","In the heat of battle, opponents can usually only conceive of 2-3 tactics to fight you with."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 319","","Do not stop until you have 10 or more feasible tactics, then overwhelm your opponent with the execution of them."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 322","","Principle 24: Make up lies about your opponent, but do not stray far from the truth."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 323","","You don't have to lie in life. But in some wars, lying can be strategic. When you lie, however, try to stay as close to the truth as possible, for this makes your lies very difficult for your opponent to discredit."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 484","","There is a fine line here. You must remain psychologically strong, which means anticipating being attacked without becoming paranoid. If you do become paranoid, then the opponent has won a major psychological battle against you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 489","","Feigning peace is ironically a master tactic when it comes to psychological warfare."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 491","","Principle 39: Boldy attack first, but pretend that you are the victim."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 493","","Come up with a rationale that makes you look like the victim of your opponent, then boldly attack them. It's best to attack them privately or confidentially, so that others will see you as the victim should the opponent try and attack you back."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 498","","Playing the victim card while fiercely attacking the opponent is high art in the world of psychological warfare."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 500","","Principle 40: Use bald morality to shame your opponent."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 508","","Principle 41: Stay adaptable and agile; maintain an escape route."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 516","","When you launch your attacks, it's often useful to have an escape route, so that you can quickly backtrack and retreat if you are confronted with enormous resistance."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 519","","Principle 42: Embrace retreat."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 520","","it can allow you an opportunity to reflect and regroup, and can sometimes have a psychological deflating effect on the opponent - at just the moment they think that victory is imminent, you retreat and take away that opportunity from them."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 527","","Principle 43: Scare your opponent with the unknown."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 538","","Principle 44: Champion your self expression in the face of war."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 550","","Principle 45: Cut your loses and embrace defeat."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 560","","Principle 46: Don't go too far in victory."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 563","","You have nothing to gain by rubbing your opponent's nose in defeat, for if you succumb to this urge, you'll allow your own arrogance and narcissism to grow, which can lead to eventual self-defeat."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 566","","Be graceful when you are defeated and be graceful when you are victorious."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 568","","Principle 47: The only enemy is yourself."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 582","","Principle 48: In business and life, you must continually develop your sense of humor, for you will go mad if you are unable to laugh at the absurdity of life's conflicts."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 589","","Principle 49: Embrace meditation and prayer."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 598","","Principle 50: Love is earned through self growth."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 605","","Principle 51: Master yourself."
