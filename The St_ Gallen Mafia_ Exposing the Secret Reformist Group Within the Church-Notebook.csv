"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 54","","“Communion for the divorced and ‘remarried’ [comes] first. Then abolition of priestly celibacy, second. Priesthood for women is the ultimate aim, and lastly unification with the Protestants. Then we will have a national German church, independent from Rome. Finally, together with all the Protestants.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 62","","It tells the tale of one don—an ante-pope named Cardinal Martini—one underboss called Cardinal Silvestrini, a few capos like the man Cardinal Danneels, who revealed the mafia’s secrets to the world, and a few handfuls of soldiers."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 100","","We are building a dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize anything as definitive and whose ultimate goal consists solely of one’s own ego and desires.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 120","","Martini, Danneels, Kasper, Murphy-O’Connor, Silvestrini. They were the key members and alumni of the St. Gallen mafia, and just days after Pope John Paul II’s funeral, they secretly met at the Villa Nazareth, a Roman college residence, at Silvestrini’s invitation.9 The way German journalist Paul Badde heard it, they had the “absolute aim” of getting Ratzinger “out of the race” so they could elect Martini as pope."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 133","","And so in 1996, when the revolutionaries held him up as the next pope, Martini founded the St. Gallen mafia. Its glue—according to Danneels’s authorized biography—was not an idea but a person. The group’s spark derived from its opposition to Ratzinger, the right-hand man of John Paul II’s conservative papacy."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 143","","Inexorably, the trembling progressed, until he could no longer deny nor hide it.15 Martini had Parkinson’s disease."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 145","","“Martini was well aware that after John Paul II’s long illness, the Church could not afford to have another ill pope,” said Silvestrini after the conclave."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 168","","With Silvestrini’s arrival in 2003, the mafia became increasingly fixated on planning for John Paul II’s succession."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 169","","“When Cardinal Silvestrini joined the group it took on a more tactical and strategic character,” confirms a biographer of Danneels.26"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 201","","But ironically—according to a Latin American cardinal who knew Silvestrini well—Silvestrini’s “big problem” came from Martini.38 Martini “absolutely” refused to back Bergoglio, his fellow Jesuit."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 233","","According to a cardinal who knew Ratzinger, had the conclave dragged on, the German would have asked his supporters to shift their votes to Cardinal Camillo Ruini.48 And rumor had it that Martini dreaded a conservative Ruini papacy so much that he preferred to act as the deus ex machina for Ratzinger’s rise."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 243","","Why did Politi,52 Marco Garzonio,53 Alberto Melloni,54 and other respected Vatican experts soon insist that Martini, in extremis, had instructed his supporters to back Ratzinger?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 246","","Why was it said that, during the same lunch break, Bergoglio had indicated that his own supporters should vote for Ratzinger?55"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 249","","Why, after lunch, did Ratzinger so swiftly metamorphose into Pope Benedict XVI, one of the fastest popes to be elected in the past hundred years, elevated after just four ballots?57"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 403","","Claiming to offer hard vote counts from an anonymous cardinal, the diary alleged that on the first ballot, Ratzinger earned forty-seven votes, Martini earned nine, and Bergoglio earned ten."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 416","","But this narrative was, as many soon realized, a revisionist history, etched by some anti-Ratzingerian hand. First came the issue of whether the diary’s vote counts could be trusted."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 418","","Based on conversations with eight different cardinals, vaticanista John Allen Jr. determined that Ratzinger in fact ended up with almost 100 out of 115 votes—not the diary’s 84."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 429","","By the end of the third ballot, Ratzinger had already secured the set number of votes. According to Politi, once Ratzinger secured this majority, Bergoglio’s supporters realized that they could not win. As one European cardinal put it, they understood that Bergoglio would not get “one more vote.”8 But that did not stop the revolutionaries from downsizing Ratzinger’s victory with the stroke of a pen—making it seem as if he barely met the threshold for becoming pope."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 435","","And according to Diat, a number of high-ranking prelates believe that the cardinal who leaked the mysterious diary was none other than Silvestrini."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 444","","Silvestrini was a major engineer of Ostpolitik—the Vatican policy that, according to de Mattei, “attributed a positive value to modernity, of which Communism appeared to be the ultimate expression. Communism wasn’t to be condemned, but purified of its atheism and reconciled with Christianity.”11"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 472","","Thus came what Fr. Claude Barthe calls the central thesis of this “post-Benedict XVI” manifesto: secularization must be accepted as the means for destroying an old, Tridentine model of the Church."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 586","","And one day, Martini would emerge as a spiritual heir to a key Vatican II revolutionary: Fr. Karl Rahner, SJ."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 601","","Ultimately, according to progressive theologian Hans Küng, the Roman Curia “was able to stop any movement of reform”—though “not completely, but half-way.”13 This “half-way” revolution generated Vatican II’s “ambivalent” and ambiguous documents."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 612","","That ambiguity and ambivalence were dangerous. Martini and others would exploit the danger to follow the freewheeling “spirit of Vatican II” up the mountain of revolution."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 614","","But in the meantime, Ratzinger began speaking sadly of the growing impression “that actually nothing was firm in the church, that everything was up for revision.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 815","","Communion for the divorced and civilly remarried, the autonomy of conscience, synodality, the ordination of married men and women, the possibility of voting for pro-abortion politicians—these were the dreams of the man who might be called the father of the St. Gallen mafia."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 996","","In July 1968, Danneels, vacationing as a tourist in Italy, watched as Pope Paul VI released Humanae Vitae, which reaffirmed the Church’s ancient ban on contraception. Then Danneels watched as Suenens and Philips gained public credibility by undermining the papal text."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1027","","“I wouldn’t be surprised if the pope also retired after 2000. He absolutely wanted to reach the Jubilee year, but I believe he would retire afterward.”18 The remarks from Danneels and Lehmann were, as James Hitchcock puts it, “trial balloons” by which “speakers ‘predict’ what they hope will happen, intending their predictions to help bring it about.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1031","","“When prominent prelates openly speculate about the pope’s retirement, it is for the purpose of making the idea more acceptable,” says Hitchcock."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1047","","When Pope Benedict invited all the cardinals to a spur-of-the-moment supper that night, Danneels, with a number of other cardinals, snubbed the new pope and skipped it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1114","","Now, he embraced the notion of moral “gray areas” in an interview that some claimed read “like the manifesto of an antipope.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1116","","He said that life did not begin immediately with fertilization but rather sometime later. Martini urged the Church to move past “the rejection of every form of artificial fertilization."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1118","","He said, “Certainly, in some situations the use of condoms can constitute a lesser evil.” Then Martini flagged the situation of a spouse with AIDS."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1135","","In 1987, Ratzinger admonished the US bishops for trying to circumvent Rome on the issue of condoms."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1144","","According to Allen, Ratzinger was elected in part because “some cardinals felt the Church was long overdue for some reforms that only someone of Ratzinger’s stature and unquestioned orthodoxy could engineer."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1155","","In Night Conversations, Martini eerily called himself an “ante-pope, a precursor and preparer for the Holy Father.” This notion was, says author Antonio Socci, a clever wordplay for evading accusations of being an “antipope.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1477","","In a glowing 1995 tribute, Ratzinger spoke of how Martini, despite all his differences, complemented him.6 And there it was—Benedict’s generosity, his largeness of heart, the part of him that stood by old friends and collaborators with uncomplicated loyalty."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1803","","“It is generally thought,” says historian Henry Sire, “that Pope Benedict’s purpose in abdicating was to bring about the succession of Cardinal [Angelo] Scola.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1837","","The Great Reformer."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1889","","Boni was saying that even an election touched by simony—the buying and selling of spiritual things, such as Church offices—was not punished with invalidity under John Paul II’s constitution. Similarly, the constitution did not invalidate elections resulting from pacts or the kind of commitments initially described by Ivereigh."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1891","","The kingmaker had done it. Two days after the election, the new pope joked to Murphy-O’Connor, “It’s your fault. What have you done to me?”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1894","","“God writes straight with crooked lines.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2122","","Then Francis smiled again and said, “Proselytism is solemn nonsense.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2252","","“The thought is enough to keep him awake at night. For it is his firm belief that the willingness to suspend judgment is the core of the dictatorship of relativism.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2426","","The Sankt Gallen group is a sort of posh name,” Danneels said, holding a microphone in an espresso-toned chair below a giant cross. He looked a little stiff, hunched up, but his voice sounded intimate. “But in reality we said of ourselves, and of that group: ‘the mafia,’” he said."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2429","","Danneels’s expression of seriousness did not soften as he said it. Some laughs rose up from the audience. His interviewer smiled with a half-nod that said he was not quite sure what to make of that strange statement. Danneels had just confessed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2441","","“The election of Bergoglio was prepared in Sankt Gallen, without doubt,” claimed another biographer of Danneels, Karim Schelkens. “And the main lines of the program the pope is carrying out are those that Danneels and Co. were starting to discuss more than ten years ago.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2449","","The election of Bergoglio was not “prepared in St. Gallen”; rather, it “corresponded with the aims of St. Gallen.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2502","","“What do you really want?” snapped Danneels on the tape, telling the victim he didn’t need to hear his story again. “Do you want this to be made public?” Danneels later asked before answering his own question, saying that “actually it would be better” to hold off on reporting the abuser.22 When the victim persisted in requesting Danneels’s help in reporting the abuse, the cardinal said only the pope had authority over the bishop—and “the pope isn’t that easy to reach.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2540","","“The womb of mercy.” An enthusiastic Danneels promised “tenderness,” “security.” And yet the sexual abuse victim who secretly recorded Danneels could be heard crying out to him: “Why do you feel so sorry for [my abuser] and not for me? You’re always trying to defend him. I thought I was going to get some support, but I have to sit here and defend myself against things I can’t do anything about.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2668","","For if Antonio Gramsci, an originator of cultural Marxism, taught “how to achieve revolution by stealth,” Silvas thought that Francis was putting those theories into practice. He was pursuing not a direct change in doctrine but an “incremental change of praxis” across the individual regions of the world, until the praxis would be “sufficiently built up over time to a point of no return.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2695","","A group of four cardinals saw the danger too. In late 2016, they revealed that they had presented Pope Francis with five dubia—formal theological questions seeking clarification."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2703","","Thick, unbroken silence came from Francis. This was what it looked like to have a pope who, in line with St. Gallen’s aims, called himself primarily the “bishop of Rome,” downplayed his doctrinal role, and pursued “decentralization,” “synodality,” and “collegiality."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2709","","“Each of us has a vision of good and of evil. We have to encourage people to move towards what they think is Good,” Francis reportedly said."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2730","","“Conscience is the innermost core and shrine of man, in which he is alone with God” (Gaudium et Spes 16).24"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2763","","Shortly before the youth synod started, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò accused Francis of covering up sexual abuse by then cardinal Theodore McCarrick. Viganò further accused multiple synodal fathers of complicity in the cover-up.36 Francis said he would not say one word about the allegations."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2933","","2015, Brandmüller had prophetically sketched the full revolutionary arc. “Communion for the divorced and ‘remarried’ [comes] first,” he said. “Then abolition of priestly celibacy, second. Priesthood for women is the ultimate aim, and lastly unification with the Protestants."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2985","","In the Vatican gardens, with Pope Francis watching, a group led by a female native encircled a mandala and bowed down before a Pachamama idol."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2997","","The cry swelled up from Benedict in his 2020 book From the Depths of Our Hearts, written with Cardinal Robert Sarah. “The Lord is asleep while the storm is unleashed. He seems to abandon us to the waves of doubt and error. We are tempted to lose confidence. On every side, the waves of relativism are submerging the barque of the Church,” they said."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3000","","Just before the 2005 conclave, Ratzinger had spoken against the winds of the dictatorship of relativism. Then, as Pope Benedict XVI, he had repeatedly stressed celibacy’s mysterious power against the storm.34"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3182","","Ultimately, Martini hailed Martin Luther as a “great reformer” but said, in Night Conversations, “I have a problem with the fact that he makes a separate system out of necessary reforms and ideals.”24"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3184","","Working slowly within the Church was the mafia’s way."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3324","","Time, the mysterious cardinal of Confession d’un Cardinal once said, is “our first master.” You had to arrive on time—neither too early nor too late. And if you made it on time, whether by “chance” or by “calculation,” you seized control of your destiny."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3344","","Bergoglio took the papal name Francis—and the pope became, in the words of The Wall Street Journal, “the leader of the global Left.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3360","","Recalling the unspoken, informal rule against electing cardinals eighty and over, the mysterious cardinal envisaged some “Cardinal X” who could have been elected instead."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3392","","Martini is said to have told Ratzinger in 2005. “You accept, since you have been in the Curia for years; you’re intelligent and honest; try and reform the Curia, and if not, you leave.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3394","","According to vaticanista Andrea Tornielli, while Fausti’s account of what happened at the 2005 conclave is open to interpretation, there is “no doubt” that Martini told Benedict, in 2012, to resign."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3396","","In one of Antonio Socci’s books on Benedict XVI, there is a chapter called “Dances with Wolves.” It alludes to Benedict’s cryptic cry after his election: “Pray for me, that I may not flee for fear of the wolves.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3401","","And yet what is interesting about the phrase “dances with wolves” is that it is not an image of open war. It is an image of trustfully befriending something dangerous."
